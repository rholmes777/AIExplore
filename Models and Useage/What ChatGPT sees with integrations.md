### Where I actually “look”

1. **Uploaded files**  
   When you click **Share → Upload** inside ChatGPT (or when the PyCharm
   plug‑in auto‑uploads a file), I can open that static copy from
   `/mnt/data/<filename>` and inspect it programmatically.  
   *That’s what I did:* I loaded **`TransposeConv.ipynb`** that was uploaded
   earlier in the session, printed its code cells, and replied based on what I
   saw.

2. **Screenshots**  
   The images you paste in chat help *you* show context, but I can’t parse the
   code inside them—there’s no OCR step. They mainly tell me “the user’s UI
   shows X,” not “the exact line is X.”

3. **Live PyCharm integration panel**  
   I don’t have a live pipe into your IDE; I see only whatever you explicitly
   upload or copy‑paste.

### Why my view went stale

* You tweaked the notebook **inside PyCharm**, but the IDE didn’t push a fresh
  copy to ChatGPT after each save.  
* The `.ipynb` I loaded was therefore older than the code visible in your
  screenshots, so I flagged a missing `text_grid` that you had actually added.

### How to keep us perfectly in‑sync

| Method | What to do | Pros | Cons |
|--------|------------|------|------|
| **Re‑upload the notebook** | After edits, click *Share → Upload file* again (or drag‑drop) | Guarantees I read the latest state | Manual step each time |
| **Copy‑paste just the changed cell** | Paste the code block directly in chat | Fast, small | Easy to truncate long lines |
| **Export a diff / patch** | `git diff` or PyCharm’s copy‑diff and paste | Compact; shows exactly what changed | Needs git or copy‑diff workflow |
| **Describe expected vs. seen behaviour** | “Overlay text shows but numbers wrong…” | Lets me reason even without code | Still need code later for precise fix |

### Token window vs. stale files

*Huge* notebooks can’t fit wholly in the model’s 8 k‑token context, but code
snippets you paste or files you upload are streamed in chunks, so I can still
analyze them.  
Staleness is almost always about **which** copy I received, not token limits.

### Practical suggestion for this project

1. **After each significant notebook edit**: upload the file again (different
   name or overwrite) *or* paste the full cell you changed.  
2. Prefix the paste with a brief note:  
   *“Here is the current `update_frame` after my edits:”*  
   That removes any ambiguity about version.  
3. If you mostly tweak one cell, a **copy‑diff** from PyCharm (right‑click →
   “Copy diff”) is the quickest, smallest, and unambiguous.
