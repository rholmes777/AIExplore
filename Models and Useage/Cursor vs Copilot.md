### Key Points
- Research suggests it’s generally easy to use both Cursor AI and JetBrains IDE on the same code project, alternating between them, as long as changes are saved properly.
- It seems likely that both tools can open standard project directories, but users may need to manage editor-specific settings separately.
- The evidence leans toward no major technical barriers, though differences in project configurations could require minor adjustments.

### Direct Answer

#### Overview
You can easily switch between Cursor AI and JetBrains IDE for the same code project, as long as you save your changes and manage any editor-specific settings. Both tools are designed to work with standard code files, making alternation straightforward for most projects.

#### Compatibility and Workflow
Both Cursor AI, built on Visual Studio Code (VS Code), and JetBrains IDEs like IntelliJ IDEA can open the same project directory. For example, if you’re working on a Java project, you can save your work in JetBrains, close it, and then open the same folder in Cursor AI without issues. Research suggests that as long as the project uses standard file formats and build tools like Maven or Gradle, switching should be seamless.

However, you might need to configure settings like code formatting or key bindings separately in each editor, as these are editor-specific. For instance, JetBrains IDEs store project settings in a `.idea` directory, which Cursor AI may not use, but this doesn’t affect the code itself.

#### Saving and Managing Changes
Since you won’t have both open at the same time, ensure you save your work before switching. Both editors support version control like Git, so committing changes can help maintain consistency. For example, after making edits in JetBrains, commit them to Git, then open the project in Cursor AI to continue.

#### Unexpected Detail: AI Context
An interesting aspect is that each editor’s AI assistant (Cursor AI’s features and JetBrains’ AI Assistant) will re-evaluate the project when opened, so there’s no shared AI context between them. This means you’ll start fresh with each switch, which is manageable but worth noting for complex AI-driven tasks.

### Survey Note: Detailed Exploration of Using Cursor AI and JetBrains IDE on the Same Code Project

This section provides a comprehensive analysis of the feasibility and ease of using both Cursor AI and JetBrains IDEs, such as IntelliJ IDEA, on the same code project, alternating between them as necessary, as of 07:49 PM PST on Thursday, March 06, 2025. The focus is on understanding compatibility, workflow implications, and user experience, drawing from official documentation, comparison articles, and community discussions to ensure a thorough response for users interested in leveraging multiple AI-assisted coding environments.

#### Understanding Cursor AI and JetBrains IDEs
Cursor AI is an AI-powered code editor, developed by Anysphere, built as a fork of Visual Studio Code (VS Code), designed to enhance developer productivity with features like code suggestions, error detection, and project generation from prompts. It was noted in a [daily.dev blog post](https://daily.dev/blog/cursor-ai-everything-you-should-know-about-the-new-ai-code-editor-in-one-place) as trusted by engineers at OpenAI and Perplexity, with over 30,000 customers and $71 million in funding. JetBrains IDEs, such as IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm, and WebStorm, are professional development environments known for deep language support and integrated AI features, with the AI Assistant introduced in December 2023, as detailed in a [JetBrains blog post](https://blog.jetbrains.com/blog/2023/12/06/introducing-jetbrains-ai-and-the-in-ide-ai-assistant/).

The user’s query specifies not having both editors open simultaneously, focusing on alternating use, which implies saving changes and switching editors for the same project.

#### Project Compatibility and File Formats
Both Cursor AI and JetBrains IDEs are designed to handle standard code projects, supporting common file formats like `.java`, `.py`, `.js`, etc. For instance, Cursor AI, being based on VS Code, supports Java development with extensions like the Java Extension Pack, as mentioned in a [DataCamp tutorial](https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/cursor-ai-code-editor). JetBrains IDEs, such as IntelliJ IDEA, are particularly strong for Java, with project settings stored in a `.idea` directory, as noted in [IntelliJ IDEA documentation](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/open-close-and-move-projects.html).

Research suggests that opening the same project directory in both editors is feasible. For example, if a project is set up with a standard build tool like Maven or Gradle, both can work with it. The [PyCharm documentation](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/importing-project-from-existing-source-code.html) indicates that PyCharm can open directories created in other IDEs, marked with a regular directory icon, and create a new project around them, suggesting compatibility with external editors like Cursor AI.

However, there might be differences in how each handles project-specific settings. JetBrains IDEs use the `.idea` directory for configurations like module settings and compiler options, while Cursor AI, based on VS Code, uses `.vscode` for settings. These are editor-specific and don’t affect the code files, but users may need to configure them separately in each editor, as discussed in a [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTCoding/comments/1ew1gbx/jetbrains_users_what_intellij_plugins_do_you_feel/) comparing experiences.

#### Workflow for Alternating Use
Given the user won’t have both editors open at the same time, the workflow involves saving changes in one editor, closing it, and opening the project in the other. Both editors support version control systems like Git, which can help maintain consistency. For example, after making edits in JetBrains, the user can commit changes to Git, then open the same repository in Cursor AI, as noted in [WebStorm documentation](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/webstorm/opening-reopening-and-closing-projects.html) for opening projects from version control.

The process is straightforward: save files, close the current editor, and open the project directory in the other editor. For instance, if working on a Java project in IntelliJ IDEA, save the files, commit if necessary, close IntelliJ, and open the same directory in Cursor AI. Both should read the latest files, as long as they’re saved to disk. This is supported by the fact that both editors work with standard file systems, as seen in [IntelliJ IDEA documentation](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/using-code-editor.html) for editing files.

However, users should be aware of potential delays in AI context re-evaluation. Cursor AI’s AI features, like “Composer” for project generation, and JetBrains AI Assistant’s code suggestions, rely on analyzing the current project state. When switching, each editor’s AI will re-process the project, which might take a moment but is part of normal operation, as discussed in a [myscale.com blog post](https://myscale.com/blog/boost-your-code-speed-cursor-ai-jetbrains/) comparing their AI capabilities.

#### Potential Challenges and Adjustments
While there are no major technical barriers, some challenges might arise due to editor-specific features. For example, JetBrains IDEs have advanced project management features like module configurations, which might not be directly usable in Cursor AI. Conversely, Cursor AI’s model selection flexibility (e.g., Claude, GPT-4) isn’t available in JetBrains, as noted in a [Medium article by Kenji](https://medium.com/@kenji-onisuka/cursor-ai-ai-powered-coding-editor-f92156f5365d). Users may need to adjust settings like code formatting, key bindings, or import management in each editor, as highlighted in a [Cursor community forum post](https://forum.cursor.com/t/please-consider-a-jetbrains-plugin/17042) where a user noted import handling differences.

Another consideration is AI-driven features. If the user relies on AI for context-aware suggestions, switching might mean losing any session-specific AI context, as each editor’s AI operates independently. For example, Cursor AI’s inline chat (Cmd+K) and JetBrains AI Assistant’s chat features don’t share history, as seen in [JetBrains AI Assistant documentation](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/ai-assistant.html). This is manageable but worth noting for complex AI interactions.

#### User Experience and Community Insights
Community discussions, such as a [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Jetbrains/comments/1gjlf6n/to_the_cursor_guys/) and a [JetBrains support forum post](https://intellij-support.jetbrains.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/22564457496978-Cursor-is-turning-Intellij-into-a-glorified-task-runner), indicate users are interested in integrating Cursor’s AI features into JetBrains, suggesting some perceive Cursor as ahead in AI capabilities. However, there are no reports of specific issues when switching between them for the same project, reinforcing that it’s generally easy, as long as files are saved and version control is used.

### Detailed Exploration of Cursor AI and JetBrains AI Assistant Project Access and Reviews

This section provides a comprehensive analysis of whether Cursor AI has access to more of the project all at once compared to JetBrains AI Assistant, and the mixed reviews surrounding JetBrains AI Assistant, as of 08:03 PM PST on Thursday, March 06, 2025. The focus is on understanding their project context handling and user experiences, drawing from official documentation, community discussions, and review articles to ensure a thorough response for users interested in leveraging AI-assisted coding tools.

#### Project Context Access in Cursor AI

Cursor AI, developed by Anysphere and built as a fork of Visual Studio Code (VS Code), is designed to enhance developer productivity with AI features like code suggestions and project generation. Research into its capabilities, as detailed in the [Cursor Features](https://www.cursor.com/en/features) page, indicates that it has comprehensive access to the entire project. Specifically, the "Chat with your entire codebase" feature, accessible via Ctrl+Enter, allows users to ask questions about all files in the project, leveraging custom retrieval models to understand the codebase. This reduces the need for manual context addition, as noted in a [Medium article by Rohit Ghumare](https://ghumare64.medium.com/my-take-on-cursor-ai-after-using-it-at-least-5-times-a-day-f9d3ff94b84a), which mentions "Project-Wide Context: Cursor AI sees how different files and parts of your project work together."

Additionally, the [DataCamp tutorial on Cursor AI](https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/cursor-ai-code-editor) highlights that integrating AI directly into the editor allows GPTs to gain more context about the overall project, significantly enhancing output. This suggests that Cursor AI can consider the entire project directory for its AI suggestions, making it straightforward for users to leverage project-wide context.

#### Project Context Access in JetBrains AI Assistant

JetBrains AI Assistant, integrated into IDEs like IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm, and WebStorm, is powered by the JetBrains AI Service, connecting to large language models (LLMs) from providers like OpenAI and Google Gemini, as mentioned in a [JetBrains blog post](https://blog.jetbrains.com/ai/2024/11/jetbrains-ai-assistant-2024-3/). Official documentation, such as the [AI Assistant documentation](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/ai-assistant.html), states that when using AI features, the IDE sends requests and pieces of code to the LLM provider, including additional details like file types, frameworks used, and other necessary context. This implies that the AI Assistant has access to the entire project for processing.

However, user experiences, as seen in a [Reddit discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/Jetbrains/comments/1ht76di/ai_assistant_access_to_whole_project/), suggest that some users find the AI Assistant lacking in context awareness. For instance, one user complained that when asking about specific files, the AI Assistant couldn’t directly retrieve contents, requiring manual input, with another user noting, "No, it doesn't have full code context, and that's one of the biggest failings of JetBrains." This is further supported by a [JetBrains support forum post](https://intellij-support.jetbrains.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/16114688973714-AI-Assistant-context-awereness), where users reported that the AI Assistant doesn’t seem context-aware within the project, needing users to supply code manually.

Despite these complaints, the documentation for features like cloud completion, as seen in [Use AI in editor](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/use-ai-in-editor.html), mentions that it autocompletes based on project context, suggesting that the AI Assistant does have access to the entire project. This discrepancy might be due to how users interact with the tool, with some features utilizing project context while others, like chat, might require explicit file references.

#### Comparison of Project Context Access

Both Cursor AI and JetBrains AI Assistant have access to the entire project, but the user experience suggests a difference in how accessible and effective this context is. Cursor AI’s features, like "Chat with your entire codebase," make it explicit and easy to use the whole project context, as noted in the [Builder.io blog post](https://www.builder.io/blog/cursor-ai-for-developers), which mentions its ability to handle project-wide tasks. In contrast, JetBrains AI Assistant’s context awareness has been criticized by some users, with reports indicating it sometimes requires manual input, potentially making it less seamless for project-wide AI interactions.

This difference might stem from Cursor AI’s design, built on VS Code, which indexes the entire project for features like search and navigation, as seen in the [Apidog blog post](https://apidog.com/blog/everything-you-need-to-know-about-cursor-ai/), while JetBrains IDEs, with their deep indexing, might not always translate this to the AI Assistant’s functionality as expected by users.

#### Mixed Reviews of JetBrains AI Assistant

The user mentions reading poor reviews of JetBrains AI Assistant, with some calling it far behind other AI integrations and useless, while others love it. Research into reviews confirms this polarization.

Positive reviews include a [Medium article by Wagner Signoretti](https://medium.com/@wagnersignoretti/first-impressions-of-intelli j-ai-assistant-461d07dc7a64), which praises the chat interface for context-aware assistance and useful code generation. A [Hacker News discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39634587) also notes it as the best encountered, especially for programming tasks. In a [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Jetbrains/comments/16gjowk/ai_assistant_ratings/), a user found it outperforms ChatGPT and Bard for JavaScript, solving complex problems quickly.

Negative reviews, however, are significant. A [Saltmarch article](https://saltmarch.com/insight/jetbrains-ai-assistant-game-changer-or-game-slinger) mentions mixed reactions, with some finding the AI Assistant’s suggestions not matching their coding style. Another [comparison article by Marco Lenzo](https://marcolenzo.eu/beware-of-ai-coding-assistants-github-copilot-vs-jetbrains-ai-assistant/) prefers GitHub Copilot, suggesting JetBrains AI Assistant produces more junk code. User complaints on Reddit, as seen in the earlier discussion, highlight its lack of context awareness, with some calling it a "failing" compared to tools like Cursor and VS Code.

This mix suggests that JetBrains AI Assistant’s effectiveness depends on the user’s specific needs, the programming language, and how they interact with its features. The controversy around its performance, with some users finding it useless and others praising it, aligns with the user’s observation of poor reviews alongside positive ones.
