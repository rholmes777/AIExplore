0:00 LLM basics
22:50 Thinking Models

Around 40:00 - Andrej uses Perplexity for advanced web search for trending items that may be in top web pages; summary. 

42:19 - Deep Research
Brian Johnson: Longevity Mix / Snake Oil
Deep Research can go into details on all the ingredients. Runs for about 10 minutes; can get preview. Multiple internet searches, thinking. 

ChatGPT is the best, perplexity and Grok are second. 
Andrej likes the Grok interface the best. 

ChatGPT 4o will create a python program.
Claude writes Javascript program.
Gemini Advanced 2.0 Pro experimental - In it's head? 
Grok3 hallucinates an answer by trying to do it in it's head.

ChatGPT has "Advanced Data Analysis"", no other model has this?

Conceptual diagram

Coding: Chat GPT, Artifacts allow one to run generated code in browser
Snippets not good enough - not enough context.
End at 1:23:00, now modalities (Speech, audio, video)
SuperWhisper for mac
1:28:00 True audio, not text transcriptions
"Advanced voice mode" in chat gpt - direct audio - no transcriptions

Grok has "advanced voice mode"
Notebook LM from google: 1:37:20 - custom podcast on a paper
Upload podcast for later listening
A paper you're interested in, niche topic, not an expert in.
Spotify: histories of Mysteries

1:40:30 - images
Ensure transcription is good/valid
Dall-e
Ideogram

1:52:30 - video generation
Veo-2 is state of the art now

1:53:30 - Quality of life features:
ChatGPT - memory.  "Remember this"
Always prepended to all the conversations. Very good at movie recommendations
Can edit memory. As far as Andrej knows, this is the only product that can do this.

Storm: Report on a topic in style of Wikipedia (Free):
https://storm.genie.stanford.edu

"Zip file of the internet" updated about every 3 months ($10 M?) - neural network of internet compressed, lossy

Post-training much cheaper: SFT, RLHL, RL. 
SFT: Supervised Fine Tuning
RLHF: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback
RL: Reinforcement Learning
