Your approach of separating text and graphs into distinct queries while providing context is indeed effective. Here are optimized strategies for analyzing specialized scientific content:

### **Targeted Analysis Strategies**
1. **Model Selection**:  
   - Use **Claude 3** for genomic/haplotype diagrams and biological structures (superior at parsing hierarchical relationships).  
   - Apply **GPT-4 Vision** for statistical plots (scatter plots, histograms) and architectural diagrams (better at geometric interpretation).  

2. **Graph-Specific Tactics**:  
   - **Genomic Analysis Graphs**:  
     - Upload the graph with a caption like:  
       *"This heatmap shows gene expression levels in [condition]. The X-axis represents [variable], Y-axis [variable]. What patterns emerge?"*  
     - Preprocess using tools like UCSC Genome Browser for coordinate clarity.  

   - **Statistical Diagrams**:  
     - For scatter plots: Ask about outliers, correlation coefficients, or clustering.  
     - For histograms: Request distribution analysis (e.g., *"Does this follow a Poisson distribution?"*).  

   - **Biological Structures**:  
     - For neuronal stacks: Query layer-specific functions (e.g., *"What does Layer IV process in this cortical diagram?"*).  
     - Tag regions with known nomenclature (e.g., *"Analyze the hippocampus region circled here"*).  

3. **Contextual Anchoring**:  
   - Pair each graphic with 1â€“2 sentences of metadata:  
     *"This brain diagram from Smith et al. 2023 shows dopamine pathways. Do the highlighted regions align with known reward system anatomy?"*  

4. **Preprocessing for Clarity**:  
   - Use **Inkscape** to extract/relabel ambiguous glyphs in haplotype maps.  
   - Convert ancient glyphs to SVG vectors to improve OCR accuracy.  

### **Workflow Optimization**  
- **Chunking**: Split papers into sections (Methods/Results) before uploading.  
- **Iterative Refinement**:  
  1. First query: *"Summarize the paper's key claim."*  
  2. Follow-up: *"How does Figure 3's Fst value of 0.15 support this?"*  

For API credit usage, the $5/month allows programmatic analysis of ~50 figures or 500 textual queries, enabling batch processing of diagrams.
