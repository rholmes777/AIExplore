## What Are Perplexity Pages?

Perplexity Pages is a feature within Perplexity AI that allows users to transform their research and knowledge into visually appealing, comprehensive articles, guides, or reports. Think of it as an AI-powered content creation tool that streamlines the process of drafting, organizing, and publishing well-structured articles—similar in style to Wikipedia or Notion, but with the added power of AI to assist in research, writing, and formatting[1][2][3][6].

Pages are designed for a wide range of users, including educators, researchers, hobbyists, and anyone who wants to share knowledge in a polished, shareable format. Each Page can include text, images (either AI-generated or uploaded), and is fully customizable in terms of structure and tone. Published Pages can be shared directly with others or added to Perplexity’s growing library of user-generated content[1][2][3][6].

## Key Features

- **AI-Assisted Drafting:** Instantly generate a well-structured article on any topic.
- **Customizable Structure:** Add, rearrange, or remove sections; tailor the tone for your audience.
- **Visual Enhancements:** Incorporate images (AI-generated or uploaded) and adjust their placement.
- **Source Transparency:** Each section displays sources, which can be edited or removed as needed.
- **Interactive Reading:** Readers can ask follow-up questions or request summaries directly from a Page[2][6].
- **Easy Sharing:** Publish to the Perplexity library or share via a direct link[1][2][3].

## How to Set Up a Perplexity Page

Setting up a Perplexity Page is straightforward. Here’s a step-by-step guide:

1. **Log In:** Sign in to your Perplexity account. If you don’t have one, you’ll need to create it first[1][3][4].
2. **Access the Library:** Navigate to the “Library” tab on the left-hand menu of the Perplexity dashboard[1][3][4][5].
3. **Create a Page:** Click on “Create a Page” (or the plus icon, then select “Page”)[1][3][4][5].
4. **Choose a Topic:** Enter the topic you want to write about. Perplexity will generate a draft with a dynamic table of contents and suggested sections[1][5].
5. **Customize Your Page:**
   - Edit, add, or remove sections as needed.
   - Select your target audience (e.g., general readers, experts, students)[1][5].
   - Add images—either generate them with AI, upload your own, or source them online[1][6].
   - Adjust formatting, text alignment, and layout for each section[6].
6. **Review Sources:** Check the sources for each section. You can remove or replace sources, and the content will update accordingly[6].
7. **Publish and Share:** Once satisfied, publish your Page to the Perplexity library or share it directly with your audience via a link[1][2][3].

- **Interactive Features:** Readers can interact with your Page by asking follow-up questions or requesting summaries, making the content dynamic and engaging[2][4].
