Yes — you’re absolutely right. The subscript in the norm notation:

\| \cdot \|_p

denotes the Lp norm, where:
	•	p = 2 gives you the Euclidean norm (standard straight-line distance),
	•	p = 1 gives the Manhattan norm (sum of absolute values),
	•	p = \infty gives the Max norm (largest absolute coordinate value),
	•	p = 3, or any other positive real number, generalizes the idea to an L3 norm and beyond:
\|x\|_p = \left( \sum_i |x_i|^p \right)^{1/p}

Why is L2 (Euclidean) used in Triplet Loss?

L2 norm is most common in tasks involving geometric distances and similarity between embeddings. Some reasons include:
	1.	Smooth and differentiable — needed for gradient-based learning.
	2.	Isotropic — treats all directions equally (no axis preference).
	3.	Intuitive — it directly corresponds to geometric “distance” in vector space.

When would you use something other than L2?

L1 norm (Manhattan Distance):
	•	More robust to outliers (penalizes less than L2).
	•	Preferred in sparse representations or Lasso regression (for inducing sparsity).
	•	Used in some text embeddings or when feature independence is assumed.

L∞ norm (Max Norm):
	•	Used in constrained optimization.
	•	Helpful when you care only about the worst-case difference.

Custom Norms / Mahalanobis Distance:
	•	In some face recognition systems or metric learning settings, a learned distance metric (e.g., Mahalanobis) may perform better:
d(x, y) = \sqrt{(x - y)^T M (x - y)}
where M is a learned positive semi-definite matrix.

Cosine Similarity:
	•	Often used when magnitude is not meaningful, only direction:
\cos(\theta) = \frac{x \cdot y}{\|x\|\|y\|}
	•	Common in NLP and recommender systems.

Summary Table:

Norm	Notation	When to Use
L2	|x|_2	Default for geometry, embeddings, triplet loss
L1	|x|_1	Outlier robustness, sparsity
L∞	|x|_\infty	Max diff focus, strict bounding
Mahalanobis	—	When learning a custom similarity metric
Cosine	—	Magnitude-invariant tasks (e.g. text, angle)
