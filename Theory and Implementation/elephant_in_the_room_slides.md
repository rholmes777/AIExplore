# 🐘 The "Elephant in the Room" Problem

> **Hartnett (2018), Quanta Magazine**  
> *"Machine Learning Confronts the Elephant in the Room"*

In 2018, researchers showed that leading object detection models —  
like YOLO and Faster R-CNN — broke down when an unexpected object,  
like an elephant, appeared in an otherwise familiar scene.

- Nearby objects were misclassified  
- The elephant was often mislabeled or missed entirely  
- Systems lacked any ability to reconsider or refocus

# ⚙️ Then vs. Now: What’s Changed?

Modern models — like **Vision Transformers (ViT)**, **DETR**,  
and feedback-capable architectures — have improved substantially:

- Better spatial attention and contextual reasoning  
- Robustness to novel or out-of-distribution inputs  
- Improved uncertainty estimation and selective prediction

# 🧠 What Still Remains

Even state-of-the-art systems still struggle with:

- **Metacognition** — knowing when they’re confused  
- **Deliberate reanalysis** — no true “double take” behavior  
- **Adaptive attention** — still limited compared to human vision
