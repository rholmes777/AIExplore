**Verifying Raycast features**

I need to confirm the current features for free Raycast with a BYO API key and compare them to what's available with the fully paid version, specifically focusing on integration capabilities. To ensure accuracy, I'll check the latest details for Raycast Pro/AI features in 2025. Before I start drafting the table, I should verify the most up-to-date current offerings. A quick search should help get this information!


**Verifying Raycast Pro features**

I need to compare the features available with the free version of Raycast and a BYO API key with the features of the Pro version, especially regarding integrations. So, I'll create a table to highlight what’s possible with the Pro version that isn’t available in the free + API key setup—such as unlimited AI messages, cloud sync, themes, and advanced window management commands. I’ll also check for any additional AI models that might require an extra fee. A quick search should help get the updated details!

**Comparing Raycast plans**

I need to summarize the integration differences between the free version with a BYO API key and the Pro version. For example, free users can’t use attachments like PDFs or images with Raycast AI chat when using an extension, and they’re limited to 50 messages. Once credits are used up, AI-related features like context injection, Quick AI, and certain integrations with internal commands won’t work. Meanwhile, Pro users get full access to these features, including cloud sync and unlimited messages. I’ll create a short table to clarify the limitations and differences.

**Summarizing Raycast features**

I need to create a table comparing the free version of Raycast with a BYO API key and its full-paid Pro version, particularly focusing on integrations. The key differences include unlimited AI messages, file attachments in AI chat, extension chaining, smart file actions, and cloud sync (including iOS). The Pro version also supports team sharing and advanced AI models, which the free plan lacks. I’ll gather sources and include proper citations to ensure accuracy when compiling this summary.


**Raycast Pro vs Free+BYO API Key**

I need to create a concise table comparing what’s possible with the free version of Raycast and a BYO API key versus the Pro version. Features like natural language access to the local system, advanced AI models (GPT-4o, etc.), and integrations (like attachments or cloud sync) are not available with the free plan. Once the message limit is reached, features like Quick AI and file-aware actions also become unavailable, while Pro users have access to all of these continuously. I'll confirm the details and cite sources.


**Raycast Free + BYO API Key vs Pro: Integration Features**

Here’s a comparison of integration features:

| Capability                                  | Free + BYO API Key     | Pro                         | Why Matters                                                                               |
| ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Raycast AI Chat & Attachments (PDF, images) | Limited to 50 messages | Unlimited                   | Pro gives full access to AI with attachments. Free tier restricts this after 50 messages. |
| AI Extensions Integration                   | Limited message use    | Unlimited                   | Pro allows full integration with other apps and services.                                 |
| Cloud Sync                                  | No                     | Yes, with unlimited sharing | Pro syncs across devices, important for teams.                                            |
| Clipboard History                           | 3 months               | Unlimited                   | Pro provides ongoing, unlimited clipboard history.                                        |

This focuses on what integrations are enhanced with the Pro version.


**Raycast Free vs Pro Features**

Here’s a breakdown of key features:

* **Cross-device sync**: Available for snippets, quicklinks, and AI chat history, but Pro unlocks these fully across macOS and iOS devices.
* **AI Chat**: Free users get limited access, while Pro offers unlimited AI capabilities (including iOS).
* **Clipboard, Cloud Sync, Notes**: Free is limited to 5 notes, while Pro allows unlimited notes and clipboard, and full cloud sync.

The free version has some access, but the Pro version unlocks the full suite of integrations and features across devices.


**Evaluating Raycast Free vs Pro Integrations**

Key differences for integrations:

* Free: No access to built-in AI with OS context after 50 messages; extensions can't handle attachments.
* Paid (Pro/Advanced): Unlimited messages; access to advanced AI models and integration that handles attachments, commands, and OS context.
* Free: No cloud sync across devices.
* Paid (Pro): Cloud sync for settings, snippets, and commands; integrates quicker across macOS/iOS.
* iOS AI and Quick AI attachments require Pro.
* Team features, such as shared commands and snippets, are exclusive to Pro.

I’ll cite sources on message limits, attachments, and cloud sync for accuracy.

### Bottom-line take

*If you’re happy opening a ChatGPT-style window and pasting content manually, the free tier plus your own API key covers most “plain text” AI use-cases.*
What you’ll forgo are Raycast’s **deep OS hooks**: file attachments, one-keystroke Quick AI, live `@extension` calls, and cross-device convenience. If those integrations sound like time-savers, the \$8 / month Pro licence (plus \$8 for Advanced models, if you need them) is what unlocks them. Otherwise, stay free, install the ChatGPT or Ollama extensions, and you’ll avoid another subscription while still enjoying Raycast as your Spotlight replacement.
