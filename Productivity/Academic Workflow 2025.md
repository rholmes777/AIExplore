**Modernizing Mac workflows**

The user likely wants us to review a 2014 list of apps for academic work on Mac, which may have become outdated with the latest macOS (Sequoia) and 2025/2026 software advancements. I'll focus on identifying modern replacements and updates for the mentioned apps. To do this, I’ll consider both the knowledge I already have and gather up-to-date information on software trends for Mac. This should provide a refreshed set of recommendations for the user, reflecting modern workflows for academic tasks.

**Modernizing academic Mac software**

Given the user’s 2014 list, many tools are still useful, but some are outdated. For 2025, it's important to recommend newer equivalents, so we’ll cover key categories:

* *General Tools*: Raycast (LaunchBar/Alfred), Espanso or Rocket Typist (TextExpander), iCloud Keychain (1Password).
* *File & Email*: Hazel 5, Apple Mail, Mimestream, Hookmark.
* *Reference Management*: ReadCube Papers 4, Zotero 7, EndNote 21.
* *Writing/Research*: Obsidian, Notion, Ulysses.
* *Graphics/Data*: Affinity, Figma, Keynote, Canva.

I’m planning to list replacements and updates, based on the current macOS landscape and newer software in use today.

**Modernizing academic workflows**

For a modern academic Mac workflow, I’d focus on key themes like cloud-first tools, cross-platform integration, AI-powered features, and automation (e.g., Shortcuts). Apps like PDF Expert, Highlights, and LiquidText improve PDF annotation, while Readwise Reader offers AI-driven summarization. Tools like Git-based writing platforms (Quarto, Jupyter) and Goodnotes Mac come into play. I’ll also explore integrating Obsidian and Zotero, and including AI enhancements, while keeping an eye on updates for tools like Raycast, OmniFocus 4, and Zotero 7 for the latest features.


**Looking up Obsidian updates**

It seems like I might need more information on the latest version of Obsidian for 2025. It's possible some new features or major updates have been released that would be relevant for the user's academic workflow. I’ll do a quick search to find the newest details about Obsidian and its updates so I can offer the most up-to-date information in my response.


**Summarizing modernizations**

I think I should start with a quick evaluation of the 2014 list—it’s nine years old, so while some concepts are still relevant, better tools are out there now. I'll then dive into detailing modern updates across key categories. Some tools have been replaced, like Raycast taking over for Alfred, and new releases and features in tools like Zotero, Obsidian, and OmniFocus. I'll be sure to cite my sources for the latest updates, especially new features in PDF-related tools and organizational applications.


Thought for 1m 1s


### How far has the 2014 “Macademic 25” list drifted?

*In short: some titles are still best‑in‑class (e.g. **DEVONthink**, **Hazel**, **Scrivener**), but a good third of the catalogue has been discontinued, renamed, or eclipsed by faster, cloud‑first, AI‑assisted successors. Below is a pragmatic refresh rather than a complete overhaul—apps that have seen major new releases, plus the tools most academics have migrated to over the past decade.*

Alfred 5 is still solid, but its community has drifted to Raycast. ([Product Hunt][1]) | Unified command‑palette UI and GPT‑assisted “Raycast AI” lower the barrier to custom automations.    |

| **Mail workflow**              | MailTags / Act‑On on Apple Mail | Apple deprecated Mail plug‑ins in favour of **MailKit** extensions; many academics moved to **Mimestream** (native Gmail), **Spark 3** (AI triage) or Outlook 2025.                                                                                      |                                                                                                      |

### Broader trends worth weaving into your workflow

1. **AI everywhere** – Raycast, Fantastical, Readwise, Obsidian, and Zotero all expose GPT hooks for summarising, tagging and even drafting citations.
2. **Share‑sheet over plug‑ins** – Apple sandboxing killed many Mail/Finder extensions; modern apps ship **Share** or **Quick Action** extensions instead (Hookmark, DEVONthink, OmniFocus, etc.).
3. **Markdown & plain‑text first** – Obsidian/Bear/Logseq emphasise future‑proof ZIP‑packed folders rather than proprietary bundles like Papers 3 once used.
4. **Universal Shortcuts** – Most pro apps (OmniFocus, DEVONthink, HoudahSpot, Bookends) now expose Shortcuts actions, letting you glue steps together without AppleScript.
5. **Apple‑Silicon native** – Check that any legacy favourite has released an ARM build; performance and battery life are night‑and‑day on M‑series (ReadCube, Zotero, OmniGroup, Hazel have all re‑compiled).

| Note that **MailTags/Mail Act‑On** no longer work in modern Mail; suggest MailKit alternatives or Spark/Mimestream. |              |

That should bring the 2014 post into the 2025 classroom without turning it into a completely different beast, while giving readers a clear migration path to today’s faster, cloud‑savvy—and frankly smarter—toolchain.
