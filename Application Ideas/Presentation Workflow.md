That's a fantastic and comprehensive brainstorm! Thank you. You've hit on many of the core challenges and potential solutions.

I especially like the emphasis on **SVG for diagrams** and **Markdown for text** as the primary source formats. The idea of a centralized "Snippets" repository with a clear folder structure and consistent naming conventions is also crucial. Pandoc is definitely a tool I need to become more familiar with.

Let's dive a bit deeper into a few areas:

1. **Markdown to Presentation Workflow (Pandoc Focus):**
    
    - You mentioned Pandoc can create PPTX directly and can use templates. How does one typically manage styling in this workflow? If I write Markdown, and Pandoc converts it to PPTX, how much control do I have over the look and feel (fonts, colors, slide layouts) in the resulting PowerPoint without manually re-styling everything? Is it about creating a good PowerPoint template first?
    - What's a realistic expectation for how "complete" a presentation can be from a Markdown-to-PPTX conversion? Is it more for getting the basic structure and text content onto slides, which then requires significant visual refinement in PowerPoint/Keynote?
2. **SVG Editability and "Breaking Apart" in Keynote/PowerPoint:**
    
    - You cautioned against heavily editing SVGs after importing and converting to shapes in Keynote/PowerPoint if one wants to maintain a single source of truth. This makes perfect sense.
    - Could you elaborate on the typical _minor tweaks_ one might do post-import? For example, if I have an SVG diagram with several components, could I easily change the color of _one_ component in Keynote/PowerPoint after importing the SVG, without "breaking" the scalability of the _other_components or the overall image if I resize it? Or does "breaking apart" or "converting to shapes" fundamentally alter the entire imported SVG into native objects?
    - Is there a difference in how Keynote and PowerPoint handle this "breaking apart" or conversion of SVGs?
3. **Managing "Sets" of Snippets for Different Presentations:**
    
    - If I have, say, 100 snippets (Markdown + related SVGs/images), and I want to create three different presentations (e.g., a 10-minute overview, a 60-minute deep dive, a technical workshop), what are some good strategies for selecting, ordering, and then "packaging" these snippets for each specific presentation, especially if I want to minimize redundant copies of assets and easily update a core snippet if needed?
    - This touches on the "Content Aggregation/Assembly Tools" you mentioned. Would something like Obsidian's canvas feature or Scrivener be genuinely useful here, or is it more about a disciplined folder structure and perhaps a simple "presentation manifest" text file listing the snippets to include?
4. **Font Management (especially for Keynote to PowerPoint):**
    
    - You mentioned using common fonts. If I'm primarily working on a Mac (with access to many Mac-specific fonts that look good in Keynote), and then need to convert to PowerPoint for Windows users, what's the most robust strategy?
    - Is it best to strictly limit myself to fonts universally available on both platforms from the outset? Or, can I design with preferred Mac fonts in Keynote, and then when exporting to PowerPoint, rely on PowerPoint's font embedding feature? How reliable is that, especially for non-standard fonts?

These are the main areas I'd love to explore further. Thanks again for the excellent foundation!
