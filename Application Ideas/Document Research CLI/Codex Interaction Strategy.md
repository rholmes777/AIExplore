# üß† Codex Interaction Strategy Summary

This document provides guidance for interacting effectively with **cloud-based Codex** (in ChatGPT or similar environments) when analyzing or extending complex code repositories like **Aider** or **LangChain**.

It also serves as a **contextual memory primer**‚Äîboth for the human collaborator and for the AI model‚Äîto remind what‚Äôs already been done and how to build on it efficiently.

---

## üéØ Objective

To **understand and reuse patterns** from existing intelligent CLI systems (like Aider and LangChain CLI) to build a **custom, AI-powered research agent** that can:
- Navigate multiple codebases or documents
- Summarize and reason about them
- Query the web if needed
- Act through a CLI interface

---

## üß© Strategy Overview

1. **Use a Dedicated Branch (`codex-analysis`)**
   - Prevents interference with production code
   - Allows Codex to safely write artifacts (e.g. `Agents.md`, `codex-analysis.md`)

2. **Seed with Memory Files**
   - Create these files in the root of each repo:
     - `codex-analysis.md`: architectural summary and module map
     - `codex-playbook.md`: reproducible instructions and prompt ideas
     - `Agents.md`: describes AI agents and lifecycle
     - `codex-notes.md` (optional): your own scratchpad with previous Codex answers

3. **Use ‚ÄúAsk‚Äù Mode for Exploration**
   - Ideal for:
     - High-level summaries
     - Exploratory questions
     - Describing modules and patterns
   - Example prompts:
     - _‚ÄúSummarize the purpose of this repo based on codex-analysis.md‚Äù_
     - _‚ÄúUsing codex-playbook.md, explain the lifecycle of agents‚Äù_
     - _‚ÄúRead codex-notes.md and continue refining the CLI docstring architecture‚Äù_

4. **Use ‚ÄúCode‚Äù Mode for File Generation**
   - Ideal for:
     - Writing or editing files (`Agents.md`, `README`, CLI stubs)
     - Adding docstrings or scaffolding classes
   - Example prompt:
     - _‚ÄúCreate a new file `doc_agent.py` implementing the DocumentAgent described in codex-analysis.md‚Äù_

5. **Persist Context Between Sessions**
   - Since Codex (cloud) is **stateless**, always refer back to the memory files:
     - _‚ÄúBased on codex-analysis.md and Agents.md, design a new agent for local document querying.‚Äù_

---

## üõë Avoid Repeated `pip install` (Stateless Sessions)
When prompting Codex, include:

> _‚ÄúAvoid executing or installing dependencies. Assume a dry static analysis context.‚Äù_

This prevents Codex from defaulting to virtual environment setup between prompts.

## üóÉ File Roles Recap

| File              | Purpose                                                  |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `codex-analysis.md` | High-level architecture + mermaid graph + module table |
| `codex-playbook.md` | Prompt templates, exploration steps                    |
| `Agents.md`         | Agent types, lifecycle, coordination                   |
| `codex-notes.md`    | Manually appended context, prior Codex answers         |

---

## üß† Context Summary for Models

We are reverse-engineering and modularizing the agent/CLI patterns from Aider and LangChain to construct a general-purpose CLI research agent. Codex is used in an **augmented memory workflow** by maintaining static files (`codex-analysis.md`, etc.) that act as persistent anchors in otherwise stateless AI sessions.

This hybrid pattern allows for **memory continuity, safe editing, and modular reuse** of architectural insights across projects.
