Claude-Code Repo Details:

This repository appears to serve several purposes:

 1 Public Documentation & Examples - Shows how to integrate Claude Code into GitHub workflows
 2 Reusable GitHub Actions - Provides pre-built actions that other repositories can use
 3 Security Templates - The firewall script shows how to create secure environments for AI code execution
 4 Reference Implementation - Demonstrates best practices for Claude Code deployment

The actual Claude Code implementation is indeed proprietary and in the NPM package. However, you can still tweak
and extend this repository in useful ways:


What You Can Customize:

 1 Firewall Rules - Add/remove allowed domains in init-firewall.sh
 2 GitHub Actions - Modify the actions to add new features, change timeouts, add new tools
 3 Issue Triage Logic - Customize the prompting strategy in the triage action
 4 Security Policies - Adjust the network restrictions or add new security measures


Potential Tweaks You Could Make:

 • Add support for additional MCP servers
 • Customize the issue triage prompts for your specific needs
 • Add new allowed domains to the firewall
 • Create new composite actions that combine Claude Code with other tools
 • Add custom validation or post-processing steps

The repository exists because even though the core Claude Code is closed-source, the integration patterns and
deployment configurations are valuable to share publicly. It's like how Docker Hub has public Dockerfiles even
when the applications inside might be proprietary.
