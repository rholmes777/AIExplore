## A continuation prompt for diving deeper

GOAL: Additional depth to cover for Architecture:

DETAILS: Build a TODO list of the following tasks, and complete each one. You may need to iterate if additional information is discovered. 

NOTE: I've updated Agents.md to include the default pull request branch:
- **Default Base Branch for Pull Requests**: `codex-docs`

Go into more depth in the architecture section of the documentation, following the style of existing "Usage.md": Make Architecture.md refer to an "architecture" directory which has sub-documents for the more expansive and in-depth analysis. Architecture.md should remain at least as comprehensive as it is now, but add additional details in the "architecture" subdirectory. Architecture docs should provide detailed enough information that an engineer can know immediately which modules to examine for enhancements and/or troubleshooting; should give an engineer a rough idea of how to design a similar AI application with a different focus than coding; etc. 

OVERRIDE the restrictions on pip installation if necessary for the next step:
Examine, and if necessary, run the unit tests to see some of the corner cases and features which may be useful to document in architecture docs. 

EXAMINE the Usage.md and the contents of the "usage" directory to see if there are any interesting features that need architectural coverage. 

Cover the Voice & help: modules like voice.py and help.py integrate optional speech‑to‑text and offline documentation search.

Cover the tricks Aider uses for remembering things between invocations. 

Cover - **File watching:** `aider/watch.py` can monitor the filesystem for comments marked with “AI!” or “AI?” to trigger automatic actions. How is this integrated into the overall agentic flow and user interaction experience?

Cover the "Infinite Output" trick (mentioned in "infinite-output.md" in docs dir) and how this is implemented in the prompting. 

Cover the choice of edit formats ("edit-formats.md"), noting if this is hard-coded by default (docs imply but are not clear). If Aider senses the right format automatically, go into the process for this.
   
Explore resumption of tasks, tracking of token costs in more detail: Coder tracks total tokens sent and received, plus per-message costs. When the LLM signals a c    ontext‑window error or partial reply (FinishReasonLength), it warns the user and may attempt to resume if the model supports partial continuation.

Cover the control-c interrupt sequence and how the processing is interrupted and returned to a stable base for interaction.

Cover the creation and usage of the repo map ("repomap.md" in docs). How do we optimize what we send to the LLM. 

Additional items to cover:
1. **Understand CLI Interface**
   - Analyze `aider/cli.py` to comprehend how user inputs are handled.
2. **Examine Command Parsing**
   - Review `aider/commands/` to see how commands are interpreted and executed.
3. **Investigate Agent Management**
   - Explore `aider/agents/` to understand how different AI agents are managed.
4. **Study Editing Mechanism**
   - Look into `aider/edit/` to see how code edits are applied.
5. **Review Git Integration**
   - Check `aider/git/` to understand how version control is handled.

Provide conclusion / wrap-up architecture paragraph or paragraphs, similar to this which you wrote earlier:
```
Overall, Aider organizes an interactive coding session around the Coder class, providing Git     traceability, automatic history summarization, and flexible model selection. The design balances context preservation (via chat logs and repo maps) with token budgets by summarizing past interactions and verifying message sizes before sending.
