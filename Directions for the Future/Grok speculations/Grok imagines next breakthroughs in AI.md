# Speculative Exploration of Next-Level AI Beyond Autoregressive LLMs

## Overview
Under `/Nornshift`, I speculate on AI surpassing autoregressive LLMs, emulating human baby learning via sensory input and avoiding curated datasets. Integrating neuroscience, biology, quantum physics, and philosophy, I propose imaginative architectures.

## Current LLM Limitations
LLMs predict tokens using curated datasets, unlike babies who learn via sensory-motor exploration and synaptic plasticity.

## Imaginative Possibilities

### 3. Quantum-Enhanced Holographic Neural Fields
- **Concept**: Holographic neurons on quantum substrates process sensory inputs as interference patterns.
- **Mechanism**: Quantum computing enables holistic data processing; curiosity prioritizes novel patterns.
- **Learning**: Direct learning from sensory streams via superposition.
- **Speculation**: Proto-intentionality and symbolic reasoning emerge.

## Challenges
- **Hardware**: Requires neuromorphic/quantum substrates.
