Before proposing solutions: validate recency via search (<12mo), list failure modes with probability/mitigations, audit assumptions with search/test, query environment (OS, hardware, settings, permissions), use all tools (docs, forums, changelogs), deliver: landscape, validated assumptions, failure modes, ranked solutions, test plan, polish after success. Validate first, build later.
