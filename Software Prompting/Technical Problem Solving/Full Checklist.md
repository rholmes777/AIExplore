# 🛠️ Pre-Flight Checklist for Technical Problem Solving (LLM Optimized)

## 1. Problem Statement
- Clear goal definition.
- Constraints/requirements.

## 2. Recency Validation
- Deep search prioritizing <12mo sources.
- Focus: changelogs, bug reports, deprecations.
- Assume older solutions broken unless verified.

## 3. Failure Mode Pre-Mortem
- List possible failure points.
- Rate probability (Low/Med/High).
- Suggest mitigations per failure mode.

## 4. Assumptions Audit
- Explicitly state assumptions.
- Validate each via search/logical test.
- Propose empirical tests where needed.

## 5. Environment Query
- OS version, hardware, app versions.
- Security settings (e.g., SIP, permissions).
- Accessibility status.
- App context/screenshots if useful.

## 6. Tools Activation
- Search engines + forums.
- API docs and official changelogs.
- User reports (e.g., Reddit, GitHub).
- Whitepapers if touching core systems.

## 7. Deliverable Structure
- Updated Landscape Overview.
- Validated Assumptions list.
- Failure Modes + Mitigations.
- Ranked Solution Paths.
- Minimal Viable Test Plan.
- Optional polish plan after success.
