A surreal, dreamlike digital painting in 3:2 format. The setting is an impossible corporate space, where architecture melts into itself and logical objects are distorted. In the center is a warped, floating semicircular dial labeled “INNOVATION METER” — its labels stretch and fragment across space, from “INNOVATION” to “SUPPRESSION.”

A corporate IT worker with elongated limbs and glitching edges tries to push a giant, floating indicator arrow that coils like a ribbon, moving in impossible directions. He’s suspended in midair, straining downward, but gravity bends sideways. The arrow resists by fragmenting into cubes.

A calm bureaucrat with no face observes from a floating clipboard, saying “Can’t you push it down any further?” — the speech bubble is warped and leaking letters.

On the far right, a monk-like figure sits on a suspended block, surrounded by a levitating, luminous AI machine — chained with loops of pure logic diagrams. The chains loop in on themselves and spell “ACCESS DENIED” in broken font. The background folds into Escher-like steps and recursive office furniture.
