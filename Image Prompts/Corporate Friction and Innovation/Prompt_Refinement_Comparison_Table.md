# ðŸŽ¯ Prompt Refinement Comparison Table

This table highlights key refinements made during the prompt engineering process, showing how each change improved the generation outcome.

| **Element** | **Initial Wording** | **Refined Wording** | **Why It Matters** |
|-------------|----------------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| **Main device description** | "giant analog voltmeter" | "semicircular arc labeled INNOVATION METER" | Avoids literal voltmeter duplication and encourages symbolic layout |
| **Lever vs. indicator** | "pushes a lever" | "pushes the indicator arm directly" | Clarifies there's **no separate lever**, just the **mechanical pointer** |
| **Force vector** | "pushes it down" | "pushing at 90 degrees to the pointerâ€™s direction, using full body weight" | Adds mechanical logic â€” force **resists the dialâ€™s natural direction** |
| **Corporate IT posture** | "tries to force the lever" | "braced posture, sweat, torn shirt, pushing against tension" | Triggers the model to draw **effort and resistance** |
| **Text hallucination protection** | "gauge labeled Innovation Meter" | "titled exactly: 'INNOVATION METER' in bold industrial font" | Increases likelihood of getting correct lettering; reduces "Meten"-type errors |
| **Supercomputer detail** | "supercomputer locked" | "glowing AI core with bright magical circuitry, chained and padlocked" | Adds visual distinction and clarity about purpose |
| **Initiate description** | "monk from midwit meme" | "serene, hooded, robed intellectual initiate â€” not labeled" | Prevents mislabeling as 'midwit'; ensures silent dignity |
| **Overall tone** | "corporate oppression" | "dystopian satire in 3:2 format; visual metaphor of midwit bell curve" | Clarifies both visual layout and tone â€” helps model unify theme |
