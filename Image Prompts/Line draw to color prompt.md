# Coloring book style

## Example prompt for remixing image in Sora to a more colorable black and white print:

Disney-inspired colouring-book style. 0.25 mm black outline only, no fills, no shading. 
Background: solid white, fully opaque, no transparency. 
High-key lighting, slightly over-exposed, very soft contrast, pastel palette. 
Plain sky â€” no stars or sparkles.
