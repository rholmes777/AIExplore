## TL;DR

Seven copy-ready markdown slides (with presenter notes) distill the key points from **“LLMs Today – models & infrastructure”** into the same bullets + notes pattern you used for the first two slides. Copy straight into Obsidian, PowerPoint, or any markdown-aware slide tool.

# LLM Stack in a Nutshell

- **Four layers** turn a giant autocomplete engine into useful software
    
    - **Model → Fine-Tune → Scaffolding → Agent**
        
- Capability ↑ **but** cost, complexity & safety risks also ↑
    

### Key Idea

Large neural nets just predict the next token; everything else shapes _what_ they say and _how_ they act. 

---

##### Notes

- LLM = Transformer trained on trillions of tokens to predict the next one
    
- Each layer adds value **and** new failure modes (e.g., hallucinations, mis-alignment)
    
- Think of it as plumbing: raw water → treated → routed → delivered at the tap
    

---

# Layer 1 – Foundation Model

- Transformer core; latest models use **Mixture of Experts (MoE)** routing
    
- **Strengths:** fluent text & code, multimodal I/O, quality-per-flop wins
    
- **Limitations:** huge pre-train cost, hallucinations, stale knowledge, opaque reasoning 
    

---

##### Notes

- Examples: GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5, Llama 4
    
- MoE fires only a subset of parameters → cheaper inference
    
- “Black-box” issue drives push for interpretability tools
    

---

# Layer 2 – Fine-Tuning & Alignment

- **Full fine-tune:** max accuracy, $$$, risk of forgetting base skills
    
- **LoRA / QLoRA / PEFT:** adapter layers, 10-100× cheaper
    
- **Instruction tuning + RLHF / RLAIF:** align tone & safety policies
    
- **RAG:** bolt on fresh knowledge instead of retraining 
    

---

##### Notes

- Pick technique by budget & data ownership
    
- Alignment ≠ censorship; it’s steering toward user intent & safety
    
- Evaluation is tricky—need domain-specific test sets
    

---

# Layer 3 – Scaffolding (Orchestration)

- **LangChain / LlamaIndex:** prompt & RAG pipelines in minutes
    
- **LangGraph / CrewAI / Autogen:** state machines, loops, human-in-the-loop
    
- **Vector DBs (Pinecone, Weaviate, Qdrant):** long-term memory for RAG
    

### Watch-outs

Prompt brittleness, hidden chain-of-thought leaks, observability gaps 

---

##### Notes

- Treat as middleware: feeds right context & tools at right time
    
- Over-complex graphs → “prompt spaghetti” & hard debugging
    
- Observability tools (OpenTelemetry-style) still maturing
    

---

# Layer 4 – Agentic Packaging

- **Single-agent:** one LLM + tool calls (function-calling, voice assistant)
    
- **Multi-agent:** planner / solver, Reflexion loops, CrewAI teams
    
- **Autonomous workflows:** always-on bots that chase goals & update memory
    

### Risks

Coordination overhead, runaway costs, governance & safety holes 

---

##### Notes

- Great for research sprints, code refactors, data migration
    
- Need audit trails, rate caps, and kill-switches
    
- Liability for actions increasingly debated in policy circles
    

---

# Cross-Cutting Challenges & Opportunities

- **Cost efficiency vs GPU shortages**
    
- **Data governance vs leakage / copyright**
    
- **Evaluation vs metric inflation**
    
- **Safety & policy vs jailbreaks / bias**
    
- **Rapid iteration vs prompt rot / tech debt**
    
- **Team skills vs “glue-code” overload**
    

---

##### Notes

- Quantization & MoE tame inference bills; still energy-hungry
    
- Embedding drift means re-indexing vector DBs regularly
    
- Hiring “LLMOps” engineers now a thing

# LLMs for a 5-Year-Old 🍦

1. **The brain** – reads the whole internet and guesses the next word
    
2. **Teach a specialty** – show it lots of legal docs, it speaks lawyer
    
3. **Give glasses & notebook** – let it Google & remember
    
4. **Hire it** – it plans work, calls tools, and asks for help when stuck

##### Notes

- Analogy lands well with non-technical execs
    
- Emphasize supervision: still makes stuff up occasionally
    
- Fun demo: ask the model to “explain taxes in pirate voice” to show versatility
