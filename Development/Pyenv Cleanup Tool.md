Okay, let's tackle this user's question. They have a long list of pyenv environments and want to know how to determine when they were created, if they've been used recently, and what projects depend on them. They're also asking if they need to write a disk search tool or if there's a shortcut.

First, I need to recall how pyenv manages environments. From the search results, pyenv installs each Python version in its own directory under ~/.pyenv/versions. Each version can have multiple virtual environments, which are probably subdirectories within those version directories. The user's list shows environments like 3.12.9/envs/plotgraphs and stand-alone names like plotgraphs, which might be symlinks or aliases.

The user wants to know creation dates and last used times. Since pyenv doesn't track this metadata by default, the answer probably involves using filesystem attributes. The creation date can be checked with the filesystem's creation timestamp (ctime), and last modification (mtime) might indicate recent activity. Commands like ls -l or stat could show these dates.

For project dependencies, the user might have .python-version files in their project directories, which specify the pyenv version to use. Searching for these files in project directories could link environments to projects. Alternatively, checking the actual paths in the environment's origins (like /Users/rholmes/.pyenv/versions/3.13.2) might indicate which projects are using them.

The search results mention that pyenv uses .python-version files to set local versions. So, using find to locate these files could help map projects to environments. Also, looking at the ~/.pyenv/versions directory's structure, each environment is a directory, so checking their existence and timestamps directly is feasible.

The user asked if a disk search tool is needed. Probably not; existing command-line tools like find, ls, stat, and grep can be combined to get the necessary info. For example, using find to list all environments with their ctime and mtime, then cross-referencing with project directories that have .python-version files.

Also, checking for recent activity in the environments might involve looking at the last modified time of files within the environment directories, like binaries or site-packages. If a virtualenv's bin/python was accessed recently, that could indicate usage.

So, the answer should outline steps using standard Unix commands to check creation and modification times, search for .python-version files in projects, and perhaps suggest scripts to automate this. The user might not need to write a full disk search tool but can use heuristics with existing tools.

I need to make sure to cite the relevant search results. The sources [1] and [4] mention the directory structure and how pyenv manages versions and environments. Source [2] explains the shim approach and version selection hierarchy, which ties into how projects specify their Python version.

To manage and analyze your pyenv environments without writing a custom disk search tool, you can use built-in UNIX commands and pyenv features to gather information about creation dates, usage recency, and project dependencies. Here's a structured approach:

---

### **1. Creation Dates & Last Used Times**
**Check filesystem metadata** for timestamps:
```bash
# List all environments with creation (ctime) and modification (mtime) timestamps
find ~/.pyenv/versions -maxdepth 2 -type d -exec ls -ld {} \;
```

- **Creation time**: Use `stat -f "%SB" [path]` (macOS) or `stat -c "%w" [path]` (Linux) to display birth time for specific environments.
- **Last modified time**: The `ls -l` output shows when files in the environment directory were last modified, indicating potential recent activity.

---

### **2. Usage Recency**
**Check access times** (though note that some systems disable `atime` for performance):
```bash
# List environments by last access time (atime)
find ~/.pyenv/versions -maxdepth 2 -type d -exec ls -lud {} \;
```

**Heuristic for usage**:
- Look for recently modified files in environment subdirectories (e.g., `bin/python` or `lib/python*/site-packages`):
  ```bash
  find ~/.pyenv/versions -name "python" -path "*/bin/python" -mtime -30
  ```

---

### **3. Project Dependencies**
**Link environments to projects** using pyenv’s version files:
```bash
# Search for .python-version files in your projects directory
find ~/projects -name ".python-version" -exec cat {} \; -print
```

**Example workflow**:
1. For each project, check its `.python-version` file to see which pyenv environment it uses.
2. Cross-reference with your environment list (e.g., `ml-ai` likely corresponds to a machine learning project using Python 3.13.2).

---

### **4. Cleanup Strategy**
**Identify unused environments**:
```bash
# List environments not referenced by any .python-version file
comm -23 <(pyenv versions --bare | sort) <(find ~ -name ".python-version" -exec cat {} \; | sort -u)
```

**Key directories**:
- Global default: `~/.pyenv/version` ([1][4]).
- System-wide versions: `~/.pyenv/versions/*`.

---

### **Summary Table**
| Environment          | Python Version | Likely Project       | Last Modified (Heuristic) |
|----------------------|----------------|----------------------|---------------------------|
| `ml-ai`              | 3.13.2         | Machine Learning/AI  | Check `ml-ai/bin/python`  |
| `jupyterlab-env`     | 3.13.2         | JupyterLab           | Inspect notebook logs    |
| `d2l`                | 3.8.12         | Dive into Deep Learning | `.python-version` lookup |
| `flask2x`            | 2.7.11         | Legacy Flask app      | Check project activity   |

This approach leverages UNIX tools and pyenv’s existing structure to avoid custom tool development. For automation, wrap these commands in a shell script to generate reports[1][2][4].
